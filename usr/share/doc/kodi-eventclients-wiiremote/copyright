License: CC-2.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED
 UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE
 ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").
 THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.
 ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED
 UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE,
 YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.
 THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
  a. "Collective Work" means a work,
     such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia,
     in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
     along with a number of other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves,
     are assembled into a collective whole.
     A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered
     a Derivative Work (as defined below)
     for the purposes of this License.
  b. "Derivative Work" means a work
     based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
     such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
     fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
     art reproduction, abridgment, condensation,
     or any other form
     in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
     except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
     will not be considered a Derivative Work
     for the purpose of this License.
     For the avoidance of doubt,
     where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording,
     the synchronization of the Work
     in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching")
     will be considered a Derivative Work
     for the purpose of this License.
  c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity
     that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
  d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity
     who created the Work.
  e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship
     offered under the terms of this License.
  f. "You" means an individual or entity
     exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work,
     or who has received express permission from the Licensor
     to exercise rights under this License
     despite a previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights.
 Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict
 any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
 on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You
 a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
 (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
 license to exercise the rights in the Work
 as stated below:
  a. to reproduce the Work,
     to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works,
     and to reproduce the Work
     as incorporated in the Collective Works;
  b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
  c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
     display publicly, perform publicly,
     and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
     the Work
     including as incorporated in Collective Works;
  d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
     display publicly, perform publicly,
     and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
     Derivative Works.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt,
     where the work is a musical composition:
    i.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses.
        Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
        whether individually or via a performance rights society
        (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC),
        royalties for the public performance
        or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
        of the Work.
    ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.
        Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
        whether individually or via a music rights agency
        or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
        royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work
        ("cover version")
        and distribute,
        subject to the compulsory license
        created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act
        (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
  f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties.
     For the avoidance of doubt,
     where the Work is a sound recording,
     Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
     whether individually or via a performance-rights society
     (e.g. SoundExchange),
     royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
     of the Work,
     subject to the compulsory license
     created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act
     (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised
 in all media and formats
 whether now known or hereafter devised.
 The above rights include
 the right to make such modifications
 as are technically necessary to exercise
 the rights in other media and formats.
 All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
  a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform
     the Work
     only under the terms of this License,
     and You must include a copy of,
     or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     this License
     with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
     publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform.
     You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
     that alter or restrict the terms of this License
     or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder.
     You may not sublicense the Work.
     You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties.
     You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform the Work
     with any technological measures
     that control access or use of the Work
     in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
     The above applies to the Work
     as incorporated in a Collective Work,
     but this does not require the Collective Work
     apart from the Work itself
     to be made subject to the terms of this License.
     If You create a Collective Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must,
     to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collective Work
     any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author,
     as requested.
     If You create a Derivative Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must,

     reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing
     by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable)
     of the Original Author if supplied;
     the title of the Work if supplied;
     to the extent reasonably practicable,
     the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
     that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
     unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice
     or licensing information for the Work;
     and in the case of a Derivative Work,
     a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
     (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author,"
     or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
     Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that
     in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work,
     at a minimum such credit will appear
     where any other comparable authorship credit appears
     and in a manner at least as prominent
     as such other comparable authorship credit.

 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

 1. Definitions
 .
  a. "Collective Work" means a work,
     such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia,
     in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
     along with one or more other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves,
     are assembled into a collective whole.
     A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered
     a Derivative Work (as defined below)
     for the purposes of this License.
  b. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license
     that is listed at <https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses>
     that has been approved by Creative Commons
     as being essentially equivalent to this License,
     including, at a minimum,
     because that license: (i) contains terms
     that have the same purpose, meaning and effect
     as the License Elements of this License;
     and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing
     of derivatives of works made available under that license
     under this License or either a Creative Commons unported license
     or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
     with the same License Elements as this License.
  c. "Derivative Work" means a work
     based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
     such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
     fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
     art reproduction, abridgment, condensation,
     or any other form
     in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
     except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
     will not be considered a Derivative Work
     for the purpose of this License.
     For the avoidance of doubt,
     where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording,
     the synchronization of the Work
     in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching")
     will be considered a Derivative Work
     for the purpose of this License.
  d. "License Elements" means the following
     high-level license attributes
     as selected by Licensor
     and indicated in the title of this License:
     Attribution, ShareAlike.
  e. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
  f. "Original Author" means the individual, individuals,
     entity or entities
     who created the Work.
  g. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship
     offered under the terms of this License.
  h. "You" means an individual or entity
     exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work,
     or who has received express permission from the Licensor
     to exercise rights under this License
     despite a previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights.
 Nothing in this license is intended
 to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights
 arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations
 on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You
 a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
 (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
 license to exercise the rights in the Work
 as stated below:
 .
  a. to reproduce the Work,
     to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works,
     and to reproduce the Work
     as incorporated in the Collective Works;
  b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works
     provided that any such Derivative Work,
     including any translation in any medium,
     takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate
     or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work.
     For example, a translation could be marked
     "The original work was translated from English to Spanish,"
     or a modification could indicate
     "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
     display publicly, perform publicly,
     and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
     the Work
     including as incorporated in Collective Works;
  d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
     display publicly, perform publicly,
     and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
     Derivative Works.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt,
     where the Work is a musical composition:
    i.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses.
        Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
        whether individually or,
        in the event that Licensor is a member
        of a performance rights society
        (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC),
        via that society,
        royalties for the public performance
        or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
        of the Work.
    ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.
        Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
        whether individually or via a music rights agency
        or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
        royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work
        ("cover version")
        and distribute,
        subject to the compulsory license
        created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act
        (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
  f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties.
     For the avoidance of doubt,
     where the Work is a sound recording,
     Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
     whether individually
     or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
     royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
     of the Work,
     subject to the compulsory license
     created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act
     (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised
 in all media and formats
 whether now known or hereafter devised.
 The above rights include
 the right to make such modifications
 as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats.
 All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform the Work
     only under the terms of this License,
     and You must include a copy of,
     or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     this License
     with every copy or phonorecord of the Work
     You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform.
     You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
     that restrict the terms of this License
     or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise
     of the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the License.
     You may not sublicense the Work.
     You must keep intact all notices
     that refer to this License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties.
     When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform the Work,
     You may not impose any technological measures on the Work
     that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
     to exercise of the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the License.
     This Section 4(a) applies to the Work
     as incorporated in a Collective Work,
     but this does not require the Collective Work
     apart from the Work itself
     to be made subject to the terms of this License.
     If You create a Collective Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor
     You must, to the extent practicable, remove
     from the Collective Work
     any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
     If You create a Derivative Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor
     You must, to the extent practicable, remove
     from the Derivative Work
     any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work
     only under: (i) the terms of this License;
     (ii) a later version of this License
     with the same License Elements as this License;
     (iii) either the Creative Commons (Unported) license
     or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
     (either this or a later license version)
     that contains the same License Elements as this License
     (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (Unported));
     (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License.
     If you license the Derivative Work
     under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv),
     you must comply with the terms of that license.
     If you license the Derivative Work
     under the terms of any of the licenses
     mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii)
     (the "Applicable License"),
     you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
     generally and with the following provisions:
     (I) You must include a copy of,
     or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     the Applicable License
     with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work
     You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform;
     (II) You may not offer or impose any terms
     on the Derivative Works
     that restrict the terms of the Applicable License
     or the ability of a recipient of the Work
     to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the Applicable License;
     (III) You must keep intact all notices
     that refer to the Applicable License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties;
     and, (IV) when You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform the Work,
     You may not impose any technological measures
     on the Derivative Work
     that restrict the ability of a recipient
     of the Derivative Work from You
     to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the Applicable License.
     This Section 4(b) applies to the Derivative Work
     as incorporated in a Collective Work,
     but this does not require the Collective Work
     apart from the Derivative Work itself
     to be made subject
     to the terms of the Applicable License.
  c. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
     or publicly digitally perform the Work
     (as defined in Section 1 above)
     or any Derivative Works
     (as defined in Section 1 above)
     or Collective Works
     (as defined in Section 1 above),
     You must,
     unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a),
     keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
     and provide,
     reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:
     (i) the name of the Original Author
     (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
     and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
     another party or parties
     (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal)
     for attribution ("Attribution Parties")
     in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
     or by other reasonable means,
     the name of such party or parties;
     the title of the Work if supplied;
     to the extent reasonably practicable,
     the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
     that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
     unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice
     or licensing information for the Work;
     and, consistent with Section 3(b)
     in the case of a Derivative Work,
     a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
     (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author,"
     or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
     The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented
     in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that
     in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work,
     at a minimum such credit will appear,
     if a credit for all contributing authors
     of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears,
     then as part of these credits
     and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
     for the other contributing authors.
     For the avoidance of doubt,
     You may only use the credit required by this Section
     for the purpose of attribution
     in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
     You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
     any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
     by the Original Author, Licensor
     and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
     of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission
     of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

      B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
    2. Exceptions and Limitations.
       For the avoidance of doubt,
       where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use,
       this Public License does not apply,
       and You do not need to comply
       with its terms and conditions.
    3. Term.
       The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.
       The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights
       in all media and formats
       whether now known or hereafter created,
       and to make technical modifications necessary to do so.
       The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
       any right or authority
       to forbid You from making technical modifications
       necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
       including technical modifications necessary
       to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.
       For purposes of this Public License,
       simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4)
       never produces Adapted Material.
    5. Downstream recipients.
      A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.
         Every recipient of the Licensed Material
         automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
         to exercise the Licensed Rights
         under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
      B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.
         Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
         automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
         to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
         under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
      C. No downstream restrictions.
         You may not offer or impose
         any additional or different terms or conditions on,
         or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
         the Licensed Material
         if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
         by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
    6. No endorsement.
       Nothing in this Public License constitutes
       or may be construed
       as permission to assert or imply
       that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is,
       connected with, or sponsored, endorsed,
       or granted official status by,
       the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution
       as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
  b. Other rights.
    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity,
       are not licensed under this Public License,
       nor are publicity, privacy,
       and/or other similar personality rights;
       however, to the extent possible,
       the Licensor waives
       and/or agrees not to assert
       any such rights held by the Licensor
       to the limited extent necessary
       to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
       but not otherwise.
    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed
       under this Public License.
    3. To the extent possible,
       the Licensor waives any right
       to collect royalties from You
       for the exercise of the Licensed Rights,
       whether directly or through a collecting society
       under any voluntary or waivable
       statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.
       In all other cases
       the Licensor expressly reserves any right
       to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 – License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights
 is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
 .
  a. Attribution.
    1. If You Share the Licensed Material
       (including in modified form),
       You must:
      A. retain the following
         if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
        i.   identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material
             and any others designated to receive attribution,
             in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor
             (including by pseudonym if designated);
        ii.  a copyright notice;
        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        iv.  a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
        v.   a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material
             to the extent reasonably practicable;
      B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material
         and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
      C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed
         under this Public License,
         and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
         this Public License.
    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1)
       in any reasonable manner
       based on the medium, means, and context
       in which You Share the Licensed Material.
       For example,
       it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions
       by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource
       that includes the required information.
    3. If requested by the Licensor,
       You must remove any of the information
       required by Section 3(a)(1)(A)
       to the extent reasonably practicable.
  b. ShareAlike.
     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a),
     if You Share Adapted Material You produce,
     the following conditions also apply.
    1. The Adapter’s License You apply
       must be a Creative Commons license
       with the same License Elements,
       this version or later,
       or a BY-SA Compatible License.
    2. You must include
       the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
       the Adapter's License You apply.
       You may satisfy this condition
       in any reasonable manner
       based on the medium, means, and context
       in which You Share Adapted Material.
    3. You may not offer or impose
       any additional or different terms or conditions on,
       or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
       Adapted Material
       that restrict exercise of the rights granted
       under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights
 that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
  a. for the avoidance of doubt,
     Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of
     the database contents in a database
     in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights,
     then the database
     in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights
     (but not its individual contents)
     is Adapted Material,
     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a)
     if You Share all or a substantial portion
     of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt,
 this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
 Your obligations under this Public License
 where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
  a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor,
     to the extent possible,
     the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
     and makes no representations or warranties
     of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
     whether express, implied, statutory, or other.
     This includes, without limitation,
     warranties of title, merchantability,
     fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
     absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
     or the presence or absence of errors,
     whether or not known or discoverable.
     Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed
     in full or in part,
     this disclaimer may not apply to You.
  b. To the extent possible,
     in no event will the Licensor be liable to You
     on any legal theory
     (including, without limitation, negligence)
     or otherwise for any direct, special,
     indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,
     or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages
     arising out of this Public License
     or use of the Licensed Material,
     even if the Licensor has been advised
     of the possibility of such losses, costs,
     expenses, or damages.
     Where a limitation of liability is not allowed
     in full or in part,
     this limitation may not apply to You.
  c. The disclaimer of warranties
     and limitation of liability provided above
     shall be interpreted in a manner that,
     to the extent possible,
     most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer
     and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 – Term and Termination.
 .
  a. This Public License applies
     for the term of the Copyright
     and Similar Rights licensed here.
     However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
     then Your rights under this Public License terminate
     automatically.
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated
     under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured,
       provided it is cured within 30 days
       of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
  c. For the avoidance of doubt,
     this Section 6(b) does not affect
     any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies
     for Your violations of this Public License.
  d. For the avoidance of doubt,
     the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
     under separate terms or conditions
     or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time;
     however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
  e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination
     of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
  a. The Licensor shall not be bound
     by any additional or different terms or conditions
     communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements
     regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein
     are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions
     of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 – Interpretation.
 .
  a. For the avoidance of doubt,
     this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to,
     reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on
     any use of the Licensed Material
     that could lawfully be made without permission
     under this Public License.
  b. To the extent possible,
     if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable,
     it shall be automatically reformed
     to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.
     If the provision cannot be reformed,
     it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability
     of the remaining terms and conditions.
  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived
     and no failure to comply consented to
     unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes
     or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of,
     any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You,
     including from the legal processes
     of any jurisdiction or authority.
