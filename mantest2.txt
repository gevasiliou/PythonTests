Run this file with a command like this :
"man <(sed -E 's/^[[:space:]]*%%%(.*)/.IP "\\fB\\1\\fP"/g' mantest2.txt)"

Though chatGPT suggests this usage:
".IP "\\fB\\m[cyan]sub sub label\\m[]\\fP""

Small Tutorial:
\\.TH => Title Header - This should be the very first line of your man page.
.br
\\.SH => Section Header
.br
\\.SS => SubSection
.br
\\.br => Line Break - should be entered alone in a line
.br
\\e  => escape (e is required). In man pages, a single \\ is not printed at all. For \\e prints "\\"  while \\text prints ext. It seems that \\\ also prints single "\\" like \\e.
