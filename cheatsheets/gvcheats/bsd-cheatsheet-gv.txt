BSD:CHEATSHEET BY GV
We have FreeBSD which is different than OpenBSD and different than NetBSD
Though, some commands might be common, since the "core" is BSD in all flavors

BSD:FREEBSD 11

##INSTALLATION OF BSD 
Get the appropriate ISO image. I used netinstall image.

##UPDATING REPOSITORIES
The very first time:
portsnap fetch
portsnap extract
portsnap update

All the other times , skip the "extract" step.

##INSTALL A FREEBSD PKG
pkg install XXX
pkg info -q XXX 					#Get info about package

##INSTALLATION OF XFCE 4.12 or LXDE

.B 1. pkg install xinit xorg xdm nano
pkg install xfce xfce4-goodies
or
pkg install lxde-meta

.B 2. nano /etc/ttys
find ttyv8 and change xterm off to on (ttyv8 should include /usr/local/bin/xdm -nodaemon)
 
.B 3. nano /etc/rc.conf
add these lines
hald_enable="YES"
dbus_enable="YES"
 
.B 4. Create xsession/xinitrc (BSD Wiki)
create an executable ~/.xsession:
echo "exec /usr/local/bin/startxfce4 --with-ck-launch" >> ~/.xsession
chmod +x ~/.xsession

For lxde i created .xsession (but i forgot chmod +x) but i also created echo "exec startlxde" >>~/.xinitrc  
Although some tutorials claim that you need to chmod +x .xinitrc , i didn't do it.

After restart i got a strange looking login screen and then laptop booted in lxde.

In XFCE installation login remains in terminal, and after login xfce is not autostarting; i need to apply startxfce4 from CLI and starts ok.

.B 5. Reboot
 
##INSTALL VIRTUAL BOX GUEST ADDITIONS
https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/virtualization-guest-virtualbox.html

.B pkg install virtualbox-ose-additions
 
Then,add these lines to /etc/rc.conf:
vboxguest_enable="YES"
vboxservice_enable="YES"
 

## ENABLE VT-x Intel Virtualization Technology.
In order to use 64bit OS under VBox, you need to enable virtualization technology in bios.
In some cases , VBox does not show options for 64bit OS but only 32bit OS are available on the list.
In some other cases VBOX displays both 32 and 64bit OSes, but complains about bios disabled VT-x , and VM is not starting at all.

.B To enable VT-X, you need to go to bios and look for the corresponding Hyper Virtualization settings.
If host is Windows you need also to enable Virtualization from Windows Components.
If host is linux you can confirm that vt-x is enabled by looking at cpu flags: cat /proc/cpuinfo |grep --color -E "vmx|svm"

if virtual box keeps complaining about bios disabled VT-x though you have enabled this setting in bios and though you can see the corresponding flags in cpuinfo, then you may solve this problem by completely powering off your computer. 

.B Not reboot but complete power off. 

It seems that some bios need a total power cut off to enable VT-X (happened to HP 620 laptop). 
After power off / power on i was ok in HP620.


Important : When installing on Virtual Box, make sure that you have enabled serial ports since by default serial ports are disabled

##FREE BSD SHELL
The default login shell is csh.
By installing xfce , bash will also be installed.
If not you can install it manually using pkg install bash
Follow the on-screen instructions to update necessary config files.

Remember that you need to type bash in order to load bash, since by default csh is loaded even within xfce



BSD:OPENBSD 6

##INSTALATION
I succeed to complete the installation on virtual box using iso image install60.iso

##INSTALLING XFCE4 in OpenBSD
http://www.gabsoftware.com/tips/tutorial-installing-xfce-on-openbsd-4-8/ (quite outdated)

I just run pkg_add nano xfce and it kind of worked.

Also i had to edit the /etc/rc.conf.local and change the xdm flag from null to NO
Before the change of this flag , PC was entering to some kind of ugly / native X11 Desktop Environment
After setting this xdm flag to NO, login stayed at terminal.
After login, i had to type startxfce4.
I noticed that windows are missing buttons so i also started xfwm4 & from a terminal
After this , xfce was working (manually) fine.

I also tried xfwm4 --replace , but xfwm4 was still not auto loading.

##PACKAGE MANAGER
http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html

Get info about packages
pkg_info -Q xfce
Will give you a list of all xfce packages in repos , with "installed" marking where appropriate.
